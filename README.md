# todoApp

Relatively new framework, Aurelia. I wanted to get quickly started with the framework, so decided to get started with official 
todo app from Aurelia CEO Rob Eisenberg
Todo App with Aurelia framework

## TODO list
* Style the app
* Check if the todo is already in the list, if yes do not add. Show proper message
* Save the todo in a database (indexdb ?)
